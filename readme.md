# Collection of Rust-Projects
This repo is a private playground where I test things out and try to improve my understanding of rust. The quality of the code in here is not guaranteed, but i try to keep it at a high standard.

## Algorythms
This is where I implement different algorythms that seem useful to me.
It is structured by sub-area but tested as a whole.

## Leetcode
in here I try my best at completing challenges from [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com) by following the roadmap on [here](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
not all problems are solved in an optimal way.
